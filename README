This plugin causes all trailing whitespace and tab characters to be
highlighted in red. Whitespace for the current line will not be highlighted
while in insert mode.

To set a custom highlight color, just call:
highlight ExtraWhitespace ctermbg=<desired_color>

To toggle whitespace highlighting, call :ToggleWhitespace.

To disable highlighting for the current line in normal mode call
:CurrentLineWhitespaceOff with either 'hard' or 'soft' as an option.
The option 'hard' will maintain whitespace highlighting as it is, but may
cause a slow down in Vim since it uses the CursorMoved event to detect and 
exclude the current line.
The option 'soft' will use syntax based highlighting, so there shouldn't be
a performance hit like with the 'hard' option.  The drawback is that this
highlighting will have a lower priority and may be overwritten by higher
priority highlighting.

To re-enable highlighting for the current line in normal mode
call :CurrentLineWhitespaceOn.

To fix the whitespace errors, just call :FixWhitespace. By default it
operates on the entire file. Pass a range (or use V to select some lines)
to restrict the portion of the file that gets fixed.
