*trailing-whitespace.txt*      trailing-whitespace


This plugin causes all trailing whitespace to be highlighted in red.
Whitespace will not be highlighted for the current line while in insert mode.


                                                *FixWhitespace*

To fix the whitespace errors, just call :FixWhitespace.  By default it
operates on the entire file.  Pass a range (or use V to select some lines)
to restrict the portion of the file that gets fixed.

                                                *EnableWhitespace*

To enable whitespace highlighting, call :EnableWhitespace. This will enable
highlighting of extraneous whitespace for the entire file.

                                                *DisableWhitespace*

To disable whitespace highlighting, call :DisableWhitespace. This will disable
highlighting of extraneous whitespace for the entire file.

                                                *ToggleWhitespace*

Call :ToggleWhitespace to toggle whitespace highlighting on/off.

                                                *CurrentLineWhitespaceOff*

Calling :CurrentLineWhitespaceOff with the option either 'hard' or 'soft' will
disable whitespace highlighting for the currentline.

If 'hard' option is used, then all highlighting remains the same except that
the current line is not highlighted.
WARNING: Since this uses CursorMoved events to prevent highlighting of the
current line there is a chance this can cause a significant slow down of Vim,
especially with regard to large files.

If the 'soft' option is used, then highlighting will have a lower priority
potentially causing this highlighting to be overwritten by other, higher
priority highlighting.  The benefit is that there should be no slowdown with
this option.

                                                *CurrentLineWhitespaceOn

Call :CurrentLineWhitespaceOn to enable whitespace highlighting for the current
line. Highlighting is still disabled for the current line while in inserte mode
